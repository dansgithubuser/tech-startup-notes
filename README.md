# themes of tool use
As a tech person in a tech startup, your job isn't just to write code. It is also to identify the correct tool for the situation. Most of the time writing code is overkill for what you're trying to accomplish. Writing code comes once you have confidence in some unique aspect you want to scale, and cannot with existing tools. A lot of what is listed here solves a problem without requiring you to write code. If your goal is to write code, you should be protected from the business by a couple management roles, which, if they exist, indicate the company is not the kind of startup I'm referring to here.

Many of these tools take tech people out of the loop. You don't need a tech person to maintain a blog; blog-builders already exist and are usable by anyone. You don't want to write a blog-builder. There's some kind of certainty principle here: either the person requesting a feature knows what it is and you can make exactly that, or they don't and there's a tool that lets them create it themselves with a web interface.

Some tools listed here are far from the role of the tech person, except that knowing a tech solution for a problem is generally a thing tech people would know. Sometimes simply knowing (and mentioning) a tool can fix a blind spot the company has.

There aren't many tools associated with this, but it's probably also you that has to make sure your digital security is up to snuff and your database of sensitive customer information isn't sold to the highest bidder. You cannot treat security as a feature, because it will never be requested, but it is always assumed.
